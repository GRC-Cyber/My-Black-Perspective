# My-Black-Perspective

As 'Westerners', Europeans and even as citizens of the world, our views, thoughts and in-depth, critical, forensic analysis of the world we inhabit are seldom procured. It is my view that our world, our society, our communities are poorer for it misses on the great wealth of knowledge and expertise, insight and many valuable histories that Black people have to offer. 

From time to time, occasionally and not as often as enough for one not to notice its scarcity, an article in a renowned newspaper or a prime time slot on broadcasting TV or Radio channel will allow for one from a confined small list of the usual black faces. They will expound their thoughts and views on the topic of the day, often 'straightjacketing' themselves into the habitual topic for a black face. Alas, Black insight into so many other rightful topics are amiss.

My Black Perspective is exactly what the title says it is. It is a platform for contributors to add their own, unique and valuable perspective to topics of their interest. It is that simple. 

My Black Perspective broadens the conversation.
